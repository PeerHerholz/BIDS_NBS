The order of stimulation target was randomized across participants. On each site, 120 biphasic TMS pulses were delivered with an inter-stimulus interval of 2â€“10 seconds. The coil was placed by the experimenter in a position tangential to the scalp, with an angle of approximately 45degrees between the interhemispheric sulcus and the coil handle, with the handle pointing backwards, for the DLPFC and 10degrees for the IPL."
